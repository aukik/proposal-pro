1. Purpose & Vision

Tech agencies (5-25 people) burn 10-20 hours per project writing proposals.
ProposalPro’s MVP automates the drafting process, giving teams a configurable wizard that turns a short project brief into an agency-branded, client-ready proposal in < 20 minutes.
The MVP lays the foundation for collaboration, CRM integrations, and analytics that will follow in later releases.

2. Objectives & Success Metrics

Business Goals (MVP, first 6 months)

Acquire ≥100 paying agency seats at$50 / seat / month.
Prove time-to-proposal reduction ≥ 80 % (baseline survey vs. after 4 weeks).
Reach DAU/MAU ≥ 40 % and NPS ≥ 45 by month 3.

Key Product KPIs

KPI	Target
Avg. minutes from “New Proposal” → “Send”	≤ 20 min
Trial ➜ Paid conversion	≥ 30 %
First-week activation (≥ 1 sent proposal)	≥ 60 %
Support tickets per 100 users	≤ 5
3. Target Users & Personas
Persona	Role & Goals	Pain Points
Agency Project Manager (Primary)	Owns delivery; creates SoWs & timelines. Wants fast, accurate proposals.	Manual copy-paste across docs; inconsistent scope definitions.
Business Development Lead	Drives revenue; cares about win-rate & brand polish.	Juggling multiple tools; long turnaround hurts close rate.
Agency Founder / Ops	Oversees process & profitability.	Billable time lost to admin; lack of proposal performance data.
4. Problem Statement

“Creating client proposals steals revenue-generating hours, is error-prone, and lacks data consistency across an agency.”
ProposalPro aims to standardize, accelerate, and enhance this workflow.

5. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope (MVP)
Area	In Scope (MVP)	Out of Scope (Phase 2+)
Proposal generation	AI-assisted draft, template library, pricing tables, timelines	Multi-language generation, advanced design editor
Collaboration	Commenting & basic version history	Real-time multi-cursor editing
Integrations	CSV import/export, HubSpot contact push (one-way)	Full 2-way CRM sync, Slack notifications
Analytics	# of proposals, avg. turnaround time	Win-rate tracking, benchmarking dashboard
E-sign	PDF export compatible with DocuSign	Native embedded e-signature

7. User Stories (Must-have sample)
As a Project Manager, I want to answer a short wizard and receive a complete proposal draft so that I can focus on customizing details, not formatting.
As an Ops Admin, I want to add teammates and set their permissions so the right people can edit or just view proposals.
As a BizDev Lead, I want pricing tables to auto-sum so I can avoid math errors.
As a Designer, I want agency branding applied automatically so every proposal looks on-brand.
As an Account Exec, I want to email the proposal to the client directly from the app so I can track sends.

FR-1 Proposal Wizard
• System shall store draft state in real time (autosave).
• Wizard fields must be keyboard-accessible.
